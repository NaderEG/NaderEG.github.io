            <p class="description">
              Hello! I'm Nader, a software engineer and a current Master's 
              student in Computer Science at the University of Ottawa. My 
              research is focused on computational geometry and graph theory. 
              My other fields of interest include data structures, approximation 
              algorithms, and computational complexity.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">Academic Journey</h1>
            <p class="description">
              My journey in computer science began in my junior year of high school
              where I took a computer science course. I quickly fell in love with the field
              and decided to enroll in a BASc of Software Engineering at the University of Ottawa.
              During my studies I was able to gain experience in various applications of Software 
              Engineering such as: web development, databases, project management, data science, 
              and artificial intelligence. However, the courses that intriguied me the most were courses
              that were more fundamentally theoretical. That is what drove me to pursue a Masters in 
              Computer Science upon completion of my Bachelor's degree.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">Professional Experience</h1>
            <p class="description">
              Throughout my studies I've had the opportunity to work various internships which have helped
              me develop a broad skillset. I've worked professionally on a web development team, as a cloud computing engineer, 
              on a machine learning project, and as an embedded systems engineer. Currently I am working as a researcher
              in computational geometry/graph theory.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">Looking Ahead</h1>
            <p class="description">
              My current goal is to complete my Masters and publish my thesis. While working towards this I would like to 
              contribute to public knowledge by tackling open problems, detailing and experimenting with novel algorithms,
              and providing tutorials and lessons on various topics. All of which I will host on this website.
